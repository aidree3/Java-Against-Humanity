# Java-Against-Humanity
The game being implemented is called "Java Against Humanity". The game is rather simple. The game will start with a chosen client, and that client will ask a question of their choice. The question will then be displayed to other clients. The remaining clients must answer the question. Once all the clients answer the question, the client that asked the question will view each of the answers and choose their favorite. The client that gets their answer chosen will win the round, and they will ask the question for the next round.
