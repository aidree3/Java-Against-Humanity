# Java-Against-Humanity
The game being implemented is called "Java Against Humanity". The game is rather simple. The game will start with a chosen client, and that client will ask a question of their choice. The question will then be displayed to other clients. The remaining clients must answer the question. Once all the clients answer the question, the client that asked the question will view each of the answers and choose their favorite. The client that gets their answer chosen will win the round, and they will ask the question for the next round.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
What you will need to install:
```
An IDE that can run Java programs

I prefer eclipse which you can download [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
### Installing
How to get the environment ready:
```
1. On the top of the repository, click the green "Clone or Download" button and select "Download ZIP". Save it.

```
### Deployment
```
1. Run "ServerFX.java". Input an open port.
```
```
2. Run "ClientFX.java". Input an ip address for the client to play from, and then input a port (should be the 
same as the server)
```
```
3. Repeat step 2 to connect 3 more clients, and you'll be able to play the game.
